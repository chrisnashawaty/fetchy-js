fetchy-js
=========

Just another AJAX/HTTP library
Made on the top of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
polyfilled with [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) to run in Node.js.

Provide a simple middlewares system, which allows you to build your own chain of operations
to run *before* and *after* a Fetch request.
